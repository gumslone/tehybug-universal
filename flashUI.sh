# Launches the TeHyBug Flasher GUI (tools/flashui.py): a single window to pick the
# serial port / firmware / baud / flash mode / erase, flash the board, and watch
# the serial output — replacing separate PyFlasher + CoolTerm windows.
#
# Usage: ./flashUI.sh
#
# Requires: a python3 with tkinter.
#   tkinter:  brew install python-tk@3.10   (any python-tk works)
# esptool is bundled (tools/vendor, pure python), so flashing needs no install;
# a system esptool is used instead if one is found. The serial monitor reads the
# port directly via stty, so pyserial isn't needed there either.
